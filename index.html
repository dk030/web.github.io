        <h1>To My Bestfriend.</h1>

        <p id="one">Hey You,&#x1F497;</p>

        <p id="two">It is your Birthday, and I don't know where to start. There are so many things l'd like to say
            on your
            Special Day. So let me start by saying the most obvious thing- You're my best frinnd.&#x1F497;</p>

        <p id="three">Since the moment you met you were like the perfect piece to my puzzle. You became a part of me and
            you
            made me
            better than I was. I know you're probably laughing right now thinking this is super cheesy and also the
            song.
            &#x1F605; Me too.</p>

        <p id="four">If I happen to have a bad day &#x1F974; you listen to my problems and you reassure me thot it will
            pass. You never hesitate to bring me back into reality and tell me to stay strong . You give me so much
            strength.</p>


        <q id="five">"We know our deepest fears, our greatest hopes."</q>

        <p id="six">I honestly don't know what I'd do in the last few months if you'd never walked into my life. You've
            made
            me a stronger&#x1F4AA;, a better me. I don't know how I got so lucky that we ever crossed paths. I guess it
            was
            just destiny; the perfect moment.</p>

        <p id="seven">I guess what l'm trying to say is that I am so
            thankful to you. Especially on a day like today, celebrate your life and I wish you so many more years to
            walk
            this crazy world. Thank you for being you. You are my person &#x1F497;. <br> Happy birthday to you, special
            girl&#x1F497;. You've changed my life and you inspire me every day. </p>

        <p id="eight">Love, <br>
            Your Princess. &#x1F478;
